# This site is a draft

I want to have some writings online, but never seem to have enough time to finish any texts, as I'm too busy procrastinating or satisfying my curiosity with something else. Hence I've decided to publish the site as a draft, containing draft texts. This site will never be "complete" nor the texts "ready". 

Then again, the Universe itself is also a draft. It started from a singular core idea that then started to elaborate on itself. I don't think the Universe will ever be ready.
